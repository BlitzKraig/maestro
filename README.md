The **Scene Playlist** will automatically play when the Scene is **activated**. Any playback settings (shuffle, play all etc) for the Playlist will be respected.

If you select the **"Stop on Scene Change"** option, any previous Scene Playlists that are playing will stop when the Scene changes.

### Hype Track
Add Hype Tracks to the **Hype Tracks** Playlist that is automatically created by the module.
